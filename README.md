Final Projects, Various Courses


In this repo, I have code for a sample of a few projects I've done for several courses. Each of these projects were collaborative. For my final project for CS124, we created a chatbot that could give a user movie recommendations based on prior interests/dislikes and collaborative filtering. It was a great synthesis of all the natural language processing knowledge we had gained over the quarter. For CS229, we tackled the prediction of increases/decreases in medicare cost for any given U.S. county with respect to COPD. This project required a high amount of data processing and I learned some valuable lessons--first, we had to how best to combine data from disparate sources. Then, after having collated the data, we found that features that do not change year-after-year hurt our predictions. Finally, we identified which features were most predictive of the variance, and only used those--which improved our model's predictions. For CS224U, my team and I tackled the effects of respect in a parole board hearing setting. We were able to practice applying another paper's (our mentor's dissertation) choices in methods to our own situation. This taught me the value of "transfer learning" in a human sense.

Important to note: these projects only include a sample of some of the code and work needed.
