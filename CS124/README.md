For this final project, I collaborated with my friend to create a chatbot that gave back movie recommendations based on a small set of user-inputted movies.

Some features we implemented include:
* Identifying movies without quotation marks or perfect capitalization
* Fine-grained sentiment extraction (i.e. handled cases where a user inputted that they did or did not like a certain movie, and took that into account for giving recommendations)
* Spell-checking movie titles
* Disambiguating movie titles for series and year ambiguities
* Responding to arbitrary input
* Handling alternate/foreign titles
* Extracting sentiment with multiple-movie input
