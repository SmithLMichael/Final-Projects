Given the continuously rising costs of healthcare, my team and I wanted to predict whether or not there would be an increase in Medicare cost for any county. We chose specifically to look at COPD, primarily because the most Medicare data were available, but secondarily as a proof of concept. Perhaps we need to be able to predict whether or not there are going to be increases in Medicare cost along certain conditions to be able to better handle preventative care to save on costs.

In this project, a few things surprised me: first, there did not seem to be previous work related to predicting Medicare increases/decreases at a county level, though there had been prior research into predicting cost increases at a hospital level and risk increases at a patient level; second, the Medicare data easily available to the public are too simplistic on their own for generating quality predictions; third, trying to augment datasets by adding data that do not change year after year in a county (e.g. adding pollution statistics that the govt. only records every five years) actually hurts results, so we chose to not add forest cover percentage, several pollutant statistics, etc.

I primarily worked on the multiclass classification algorithms we used, as well as researching prior works.
